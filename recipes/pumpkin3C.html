        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            One year my brother came to the family gathering with a box of cookies 
            and this recipe to share. Our family devoured them. Now I share them 
            with you, hopefully you enjoy them as much as we do.

                <li>1 teaspoon milk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Combine pumpkin, sugar, oil, and egg in a large bowl. Dissolve baking soda into milk in a small bowl and stir in.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture and mix well. Add chocolate chips, walnuts, and vanilla; stir just to combine.</li>
